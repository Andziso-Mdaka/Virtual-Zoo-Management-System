# Virtual Zoo Management

This project is a simple virtual zoo management system implemented in C# using Windows Forms. It allows users to add different types of animals to the zoo and invoke behaviors on the selected animal.

## Features

- Add animals to the zoo: Users can add animals to the zoo by entering their name, age, and selecting their type (Carnivore, Bird, or Aquatic).
- View list of animals: The application displays a list of animals currently in the zoo, showing their name, type, and age.
- Invoke behaviors: Users can select an animal from the list and invoke behaviors such as speaking, moving, and eating.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio or your preferred C# development environment.
3. Build the solution to ensure there are no errors.
4. Run the application to launch the Virtual Zoo Management System.
5. Use the "Add Animal" button to add animals to the zoo.
6. Select an animal from the list and use the "Invoke Behavior" button to invoke behaviors on the selected animal.

## Troubleshooting

- If nothing happens when using the application, ensure that the event handlers are correctly wired up to the buttons and that the form is being displayed properly.
- Check for any error messages or exceptions in the Output window of Visual Studio.
- Use debugging tools to step through the code and identify any issues.
